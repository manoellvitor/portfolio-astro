        I'm an experienced software engineer 💻 with proficiency in backend
        technologies like Node.js and Python, as well as frontend tools like
        React.js, Astro, and Next.js. I excel in CSS3 styling and utilize modern
        frameworks like Tailwind CSS. My database expertise includes PostgreSQL,
        MongoDB, and MariaDB, with proficiency in ORMs like Prisma and
        SQLAlchemy. I've worked with frameworks like FastAPI and Express. My
        Agile Methodologies background complements my strong QA skills, covering
        manual and automated testing with Selenium, Cypress, and Playwright. On
        a personal note, I'm an inline hockey enthusiast 🏒 and a devoted fan of
        Harry Potter ⚡ and Lord of the Rings 🌄.
