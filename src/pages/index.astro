      I'm an experienced software engineer 💻 with proficiency in backend
      technologies like Node.js and Python, as well as frontend tools like
      React.js, Astro, and Next.js. I excel in CSS3 styling and utilize modern
      frameworks like Tailwind CSS. My database expertise includes PostgreSQL,
      MongoDB, and MariaDB, with proficiency in ORMs like Prisma and SQLAlchemy.
      I've worked with frameworks like FastAPI and Express. My Agile
      Methodologies background complements my strong QA skills, covering manual
      and automated testing with Selenium, Cypress, and Playwright. On a
      personal note, I'm an inline hockey enthusiast 🏒 and a devoted fan of
      Harry Potter ⚡ and Lord of the Rings 🌄.
